Check-in <br>
The apartment will be ready for you after 2 o'clock. <br> 
     We will put a key in a small key locker next to the door. The code to open it will be sent to you prior your arrival.<br>
Every guest staying in Croatia must be registered with the Croatian Tourist Board through the eVisitor information system for registration and de-registration of tourists.<br>
More about that you can read <a href="./IMG_2052.jpeg">here:</a>

For that purpose we left you a paper form to fill it out with your personal details. <br>
Once you completed the form please put it in the mail box on the terrace. Thank you!
  </P>
    <p>Check-out<br>
        Please check out by 10 am. <br>
        Checking out by this time ensures  that we have enough time to clean and get the apartment ready for our next guests.<br>If the upcoming guests schedule allows us more time, we can arrange that you leave later, but please ask that in advance.<br>
        When you check out please lock the apartment and put the key back into the key locker.
